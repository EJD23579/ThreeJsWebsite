        <h2> Hello! </h2>
        <p1> Did you know that the U.K has one of the most monolingual populations of any country in the world? 62% of Brits can only speak English, while the figures in Europe are almost completely the opposite, with approximately 56% of Europeans speaking a second language.</p1>
        <p1> As a U.K based language nerd, this makes me sad. Therefore, I have created this Website/Application to help people to find language exchange partners.</p1>
    </section>





    <section id="Language Exchange">
        <h2> Language Exchange </h2>
        <p1> The best way to learn a new language is to interact with native speakers. This can definitely be daunting, so to solve this problem, LinguaXchng will help members to find speakers of their target language who are happy to help you learn.

    <section id="Information">
        <h2> Information </h2>
        <p1> Another feature of LinguaXchng is to find the languages spoken in your area. Being from a city full of foreign culture, whenever I hear
             a foreign language I am always interested to know what language is being spoken. 
             another benefit of this is that you can create new connections with people in your area. Maybe you frequent a local Turkish cafe and want to show your appreciation for their customer service? What better way than by
             showing a real and genuine interest in their culture and language! </p1>

    <section id="Manifesto">
        <h2>ðŸ“œ Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
            My Goal with this project is to foster a love and appreciation of foreign languages and cultures,
            to celebrate our differences and find common ground to become a more integrated, tolerant and vibrant society.
